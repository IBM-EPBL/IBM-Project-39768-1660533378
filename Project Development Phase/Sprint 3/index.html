    <div><h1>Handwritten Recognition System</h1></div>
    <div><p>Handwritten Text Recognition is a technology that is much beeded in this world as of today. This digit Recognition system 
        is used to recognize the digits from different sources like emails, bank cheque, papers, images, etc. Before proper 
        implementation of this technology we have relied on writing texts with our own hands which can result in errrorss, it's
        difficult to store and access physical data with efficiency. The project presents recognizing the handwritten digits(0 to 9)
        from the famous MNIST dataset. Here we will be using artificial neural networks convolution neural network.</p></div>
